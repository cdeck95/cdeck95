# Hi there, I'm Chris Deck üëã

## Full-Stack Software Developer

With a foundation in computer science and a specialization in cybersecurity from Rowan University, I've evolved from entry-level software development roles to a Senior Information Security Specialist at TD Bank. After seven years in cybersecurity, I'm pivoting back to my roots in software development, driven by a passion for creating impactful solutions. My expertise lies in React, TypeScript, Python, HTML/JS, AWS, and more. I'm also experienced with Docker, YAML files, and CI/CD pipelines. 

## üöÄ Projects

- **[Disc Rescue Network](https://discrescuenetwork.com)**: A scalable lost and found platform for disc golf courses, automating inventory management and text notifications. Built with ReactJS, TypeScript, and a Python backend, using Docker and AWS Elastic Beanstalk for deployment.
- **BestBet**: A cross-platform mobile app built in C# using Xamarin, leveraging an odds-API to provide the best betting odds. It includes AWS Lambda functions and user authentication via AWS Cognito.
- **LinkUp**: A mobile app for iOS and Android that integrates with a python API and various AWS Lambda functions. It features user authentication via AWS Cognito. The app will generate "profiles" linked to QR codes that include details/links to your social media accounts. Fully customizable and sticky. Once you share a profile with someone, the "business card" will be updated in real-time when accounts are modified. 
- **FuryOfTheFur**: Web application integrated with Web3 technologies, offering an NFT Dashboard with minting, burning, and more. Built with ReactJS, TypeScript, and deployed through Netlify.
